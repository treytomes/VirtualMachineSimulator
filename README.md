# VirtualMachineSimulator
My rendition of the KVM screensaver in C#/OpenTK.

I wrote this based on the C++/DirectX code from this article on Code Project:
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5863/Windows-Virtual-Machine-screen-saver, which was written based on the Linux KVM Virtual Machine screen saver.

You can configure the simulator using the settings in the application configuration file.  Otherwise, look in the Simulation namespace (https://github.com/treytomes/VirtualMachineSimulator/tree/master/VirtualMachineScreenSaver/VirtualMachineScreenSaver/Simulation) to see how the virtual machine actually works.
